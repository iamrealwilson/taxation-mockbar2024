One month after, Rainier sold the lot and building to Health Smoke Company (HSC) for P200 million. Lucky filed its annual tax return and declared its gain from the sale of the lot and building in the amount of P750,000.00An investigation conducted by the BIR revealed that two months prior to the sale of the properties to Rainier, Lucky received P40 million from HSC and not from Rainier. Said amount of P40 million was debited by HSC and reflected in its trial balance as “other inv. — Lucky Bldg.” The month after, another P40million was reflected in HSC’s trial balance as “other inv. — Lucky Bldg.” The BIR concluded that there is tax evasion since the real buyer of the properties of Lucky is HSC and not Rainier. It issued an assessment for deficiency income tax in the amount of P79 million against Lucky. Lucky argues that it resorted to tax avoidance or a tax saving device, which is allowed by the NIRC and BIR rules since it paid the correct taxes based on its sale to Rainier.

For the 2nd quarter of 1983, these U.S.- based individual and corporate stockholders received cash dividends from the corporation. The corresponding withholding tax on dividend income — 30% for individual and 35% for corporate non-resident stockholders — was deducted at source and remitted to the BIR.On May 15,1984, ABCD filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a formal claim for refund, alleging that under the RP-US Tax Treaty, the deduction withheld at source as tax on dividends earned was fixed at 25% of said income. Thus, ABCD asserted that it overpaid the withholding tax due on the cash dividends given to its non-resident stockholders in the U.S. the Commissioner denied the claim.On January 17, 1985, ABCD filed a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reiterating its demand for refund.Is the contention of ABCD Corporation correct?

SAA sells airplane tickets through Narotel, and these tickets are serviced by SAA airplanes outside the Philippines. The total sales of airplane tickets transacted by Narotel for SAA in 2012 amounted to PIO,000,000.00 The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) assessed SAA deficiency income taxes at the rate of 30% on its taxable income, finding that SAA’s airline ticket sales constituted income derived from sources within the Philippines. SAA filed a protest on the ground that the alleged deficiency income taxes should be considered as income derived exclusively from sources outside the Philippines since SAA only serviced passengers outside Philippine territory. It, thus, asserted that the imposition of such income taxes violated the principle of territoriality in taxation. Is the theory of SAA tenable? Explain. (5%) (2016 Bar Question)"

For the 2nd quarter of 1983, these U.S.- based individual and corporate stockholders received cash dividends from the corporation. The corresponding withholding tax on dividend income — 25% for individual and 30% for corporate non-resident stockholders — was deducted at source and remitted to the BIR.On May 15,1984, ABCD filed with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a formal claim for refund, alleging that under the RP-US Tax Treaty, the deduction withheld at source as tax on dividends earned was fixed at 25% of said income. Thus, ABCD asserted that it overpaid the withholding tax due on the cash dividends given to its non-resident stockholders in the U.S. the Commissioner denied the claim.On January 17, 1985, ABCD filed a petition with the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) reiterating its demand for refund.Does ABCD Corporation have the legal personality to file the refund on behalf of its non-resident stockholders?

In accordance with the Local Government Code (LGC), the Sangguniang Panglungsod (SP) of Baguio City enacted Tax Ordinance No. 19, Series of 2014, imposing a P50.00 tax on all the tourists and travellers going to Baguio City. In imposing the local tax, the SP reasoned that the tax collected will be used to maintain the cleanliness of Baguio City and for the beautification of its tourist attractions. (D) is punishable by administrative penalty only.Claiming the tax to be unjust, Baguio Travellers Association (BTA), an association of travel agencies in Baguio City, filed a petition for declaratory relief before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) because BTA was apprehensive that tourists might cancel their bookings with BTA’s member agencies. BTA also prayed for the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) to enjoin Baguio City from enforcing the local tax on their customers and on all tourists going to Baguio City.The RTC issued a TRO enjoining Baguio City from imposing the local tax. Aggrieved, Baguio City filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to set aside the TRO issued by the RTC on the ground that collection of taxes cannot be enjoined. Will the petition prosper? (5%) (2014 Bar Question)"

Among those subjected to the occupation tax were lawyers. Atty. Mariano Batas, who has a law office in Manila, pays the ordinance-imposed occupation tax under protest. He goes to court to assail the validity of the ordinance for being discriminatory. Decide with reasons. (3%) (2009 Bar Question)SUGGESTED ASNWER:The ordinance is valid. The tax imposed by the ordinance is in the nature of a professional tax which is authorized by law to be imposed by cities {Section 151 in relation to Section 139, LGC). The ordinance is not discriminatory because the City Council has the power to select the subjects of taxation and impose the same tax on those belonging to the same class. The authority given by law to cities is to impose a professional tax only on persons engaged in the practice of their profession requiring government examination and lawyers are included within that class of professionals."

During an audit investigation made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), the BIR assessed the company for failure to withhold the corresponding withholding tax on the amount equivalent to the one sack of rice received by all the employees, contending that the sack of rice is considered as additional compensation for the rank and file employees and additional fringe benefit for the supervisions and managers. Therefore, the value of the one sack of rice every month should be considered as part of the compensation of the rank and file subject to tax.
